# 🧠 Multi-Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases — Diabetes, Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, and Liver Disease — using machine learning ensemble models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, KNN).

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
- Joblib (Model persistence)

## 🧩 Features
- Trains four separate models using medical datasets
- Single form input for predicting all diseases
- Displays top probable diseases based on user data

## 🏗️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ananya-Kundarapu/Multi-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Multi-Disease-Prediction
